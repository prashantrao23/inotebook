We are creating endpoint in Thunder client, create user. login, get logged in user  


*********** FrontEnd ******************

npm i -g concurrently -> so that we can run both backend and frontend simultanuosly 
in package.json we have added this command -->> "both": "concurrently \"npm run start\" \"nodemon backend/index.js\""
Run multiple commands concurrently. Like npm run watch-js & npm run watch-less but better.
command -> npm run both

npm i react-router-dom -> for routing
